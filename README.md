### README:

Welcome to my JavaScript Code Quiz repository!
The purpose of this repository is to briefly test a user's knowledge on JavaScript!
In this repository, the user will find a quiz containing 4 questions that will be displayed randomly so they can't memorize the answers easily if the user were to have the order memorized. 
The user will be given 2 minutes to complete the quiz. 
If the user answers the question wrong, 10 seconds will be taken off their timer.
At the end of the quiz, the user will be able to submit their score and restart the quiz if they want to try again and aim for 100%.
